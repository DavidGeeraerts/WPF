# Windows Post Flight commander
1.	Configures local administrator account
2.	Configures local hard drives on the computer
3.	Renames the computer
4.	Joins a domain (or not)
5.	Runs customized Chocolatey package list based on hostname
6.	Runs Windows Ultimate commandlet


## WINDOWS ULTIMATE COMMANDLET

The commandlet should be thoroughly tested to ensure it doesn't break the main Windows Post Flight Commandlet.

As a suggestion for authoring a Ultimate commandlet, make 3 sections:
(most activities will fall into one of these sections)

[1]	INSTALLATIONS

[2]	CONFIGURATIONS

[3]	CLEANUP
